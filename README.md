# Wumpus World Solver

## Description
The Wumpus World Solver is an AI-based project that aims to solve the Wumpus World problem, a classic problem in artificial intelligence. The Wumpus World is a simple grid-based puzzle game where an agent navigates through a maze-like environment with hidden dangers like pits and a lurking Wumpus (monster). The goal is for the agent to safely navigate the world, avoid hazards, and find the gold.

## Features
1. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** The project provides a graphical interface using the Pygame library, allowing users to interact with the Wumpus World visually.
2. **Automatic Solver:** The project includes an automatic solver that utilizes logic-based reasoning and resolution techniques to navigate the Wumpus World safely.
3. **Random Map Generator:** Users can generate random maps of varying sizes with customizable numbers of pits, Wumpus, and gold using the provided random map generator function.
4. **Scoring System:** The game includes a scoring system that rewards points for successful actions like picking up gold and penalizes for hazards encountered or unsuccessful attempts.
5. **Game Over Handling:** When the game ends, whether in victory or defeat, the system displays a game-over message along with the final score.

## How to Use
1. **Setup:** Install the necessary dependencies including Pygame and PIL (Python Imaging Library).
2. **Run:** Execute the main Python script to start the game.
3. **Interact:** Use arrow keys or specified controls to navigate the agent through the Wumpus World.
4. **Automate:** Alternatively, engage the automatic solver to observe its strategy and performance.
5. **Customize:** Experiment with different map sizes and hazard configurations using the random map generator function.

## Future Enhancements
1. **Improved AI Strategies:** Enhance the automatic solver with more sophisticated AI algorithms for better decision-making.
2. **Expanded UI Features:** Add more interactive elements to the GUI such as tooltips, status indicators, and level selection.
3. **Multiplayer Mode:** Introduce a multiplayer mode where players can compete or collaborate to solve the Wumpus World together.
4. **Advanced Graphics:** Upgrade the visual presentation with enhanced graphics, animations, and effects.
5. **Community Contributions:** Encourage contributions from the open-source community to extend functionality, fix bugs, and optimize performance.
